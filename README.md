# 3cxcall_automation
This C# code connects to a 3CX PBX system and initiates a series of phone calls from a specified extension to a list of phone numbers. It iterates through each number in the array, making a call and pausing for 5 seconds between each attempt. If a call fails, an error message is displayed. The process completes after all calls have been attempted.
